# My Kubernetes

My personal production Kubernetes setup. This is probably useless for you,
but free to use anything you find here.

Based on [Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/) and [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/).

A description of how I deploy nodes and manifests can be found in
[DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md), which exists mostly for me in case I need to deploy
from scratch.

There are some notes in [NOTES.md](NOTES.md), also mostly for me.
